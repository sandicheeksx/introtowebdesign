    <h1> 24 HOURS IN PORTO</h1>
    <p>Twenty-four hours in Porto? No problem, through personal experience I traveled to Porto for less than two days to experience enough that I would be hungry to go back again.</p>

      <h3>Luís I Bridge</h3>
      <p>If you wake up early around 7-8 AM there are absolutely barely any folks wandering the streets. You can walk along the bridge without worrying about cars or other tourists blocking that perfect photo you want to capture.</p>

      <h3>Manteigaria - Fábrica de Pastéis de Nata</h3>
      <p>If you visit Portugal you must try these famous egg tart pastries! They are a traditional snack here that are absolutely delicious. You have the option to dust some cinnamon sugar for that extra flavor. They are a cross between a custard tart and a cake. The outside is super flakey and the inside is filled with a creamy and sweet custard.</p>

      <h3>Livraria Lello</h3>
      <p>If you love to read you must stop by this beautiful library. The line was long and the process to get tickets are not very simple in person. Make sure you purchase tickets from the bookshop located on the corner next to Livraria Lello first before waiting in line. The wait time was approximately half an hour to an hour.</p>

      <h3>Café Santiago - Famous Francesinha sandwich</h3>
      <p>We waited outside with empty stomachs waiting to try the famous Francesinha sandwich. It is made with bread, wet-cured ham, linguiça, fresh sausage like chipolata, steak or roast meat, and covered with melted cheese and a hot and thick spiced tomato and beer sauce. It is normally served with french fries. This restaurant is specifically known for this sandwich, it was absolutely worth the wait!</p>

      <h3>Ribeira Square</h3>
      <p>There are a lot of restaurants and shops to bring back local gifts for yourself, friends and family. It is located right next to the Douro River and the Luís I Bridge. There were plenty of tent vendors selling unique goods such as tiles, placemats, and many trinkets.</p>

      <h3>O Paparico</h3>
      <p>If you like good food and fine dining this place is perfect. The setting is rustic with centuries-old rock walls, wooden tables, and elegant chandeliers. This place was cozy and has some of the best foods I have tried during my Portugal visit.</p>
